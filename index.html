    <h1>Tianyi Wu</h1>

    <p> My name is Tianyi Wu (吴天意), a junior in Peking University's EECS Turing Program. I spent wonderful time doing research under the guidance of Liwei Wang, Xiaotie Deng, Mengdi Wang, Kaiqing Zhang and Shaofeng Jiang. </p>

    <p> Generally speaking, I'm doing research on the application of computer science and artificial intelligence, aiming to solve the fundemental problems in various fields. Recently, I have been concentrating on mathematical research and game design, utilizing tools such as large language models, deep neural networks, parallel computing, computer algebra, and general algorithm design. </p>

    <p> Besides, I also enjoy insightful theory and I have learnt a lot, such as theoretical computer science, logic and programming language theory, and even pure mathematics. I believe that these elegant theories are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also accidentally provide important insights for solving real-world problems. </p>

    <p> ”君子不器”("A noble person is not a tool”) is my research philosophy. I think an applied researcher should master a wide range of tools and focus on concrete problems and pain points. </p>
